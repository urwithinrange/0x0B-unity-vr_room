# 0x00. Unity - VR Room

## Learning Objectives

+ What are the different types of locomotion / movement in VR
+ What causes VR motion sickness
+ What are the different methods of minimizing VR motion sickness in locomotion implementations
+ How to implement a teleportation method of movement in VR
+ How to implement interactive objects in VR

This is the first project using VR locomotion and making objects interacable for the user.  for this project I utilized teleportation for moving around the scene. 
All interactable objects will highlight when the "ray interactor" hovers on an object that is potentially useful. 
Most small object in the scene are interactable, even if they do not highlight. 
Lastly when the console in the main room is activated a star cluster is holographicly displayed around the room.
